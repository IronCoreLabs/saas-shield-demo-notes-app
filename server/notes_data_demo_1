{"category":"Gardening","title":"When should I plant potatoes?","body":"Potatoes can be planted as soon as the soil can be easily worked. This is usually about 2 weeks after the last spring frost. Early crops can be ruined if the soil is too wet which can cause the potato seed to rot. The soil should not be so wet that it sticks together and is difficult to work. ", "attachments":[]}
{"category":"Gardening","title":"How can I fertilize my garden naturally?","body":"The most beneficial natural fertilizers are:\\n1. Compost\\nCompost reigns supreme in the world of natural fertilizers. This nutrient-rich material is created by the decomposition of organic matter like food scraps, yard waste, and leaves. Compost feeds the soil microbiome, improves soil structure, and provides a slow-release source of essential nutrients for a wide range of plants.\\n\\n2. Grass Clippings\\nA readily available source of nitrogen, grass clippings can be a valuable addition to your garden’s fertilizer arsenal. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:\\n   Fresh vs. Dried: Fresh clippings can mat down and hinder air circulation. Let them dry for a day or two before adding them to your garden.\\n   Nitrogen Boost: Grass clippings are a green material, high in nitrogen. This is great for leafy vegetables but not ideal for flowering plants that require more phosphorus.\\n   Herbicide Warning: If you’ve recently treated your lawn with herbicides, avoid using those clippings in your vegetable garden.\\n\\n3. Manure\\nManure is a fantastic source of organic matter and nutrients for your garden. However, different types of manure have varying nutrient profiles. Here’s a quick breakdown:\\n   Cow Manure: A well-rounded fertilizer rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Aged cow manure is best to avoid burning tender plants.\\n   Chicken Manure: Very high in nitrogen, chicken manure is best composted before using in the garden.\\n   Horse Manure: A good source of nitrogen and potassium, horse manure heats up as it decomposes, making it ideal for raised beds.", "attachments":[]}

{"category":"Punk Rock","title":"Origins of Punk","body":"Punk rock (also known as simply punk) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s rock and roll and 1960s garage rock, punk bands rejected the corporate nature of mainstream 1970s rock music. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles with stripped-down instrumentation.

Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent labels.", "attachments":[]}

{"category":"Games","title":"Craps","body":"Craps developed in the United States from a simplification of the western European game of hazard. The origins of hazard are obscure and may date to the Crusades. Hazard was brought from London to New Orleans in approximately 1805 by the returning Bernard Xavier Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville, the young gambler and scion of a family of wealthy landowners in colonial Louisiana. Although in hazard the dice shooter may choose any number from five to nine to be his main number, de Marigny simplified the game such that the main number is always seven, which is the mathematically optimal choice (choice with the lowest disadvantage for the shooter). Both hazard and its simpler derivative were unfamiliar to and rejected by Americans of his social class, leading de Marigny to introduce his novelty to the local underclass. Field hands taught their friends and deckhands, who carried the new game up the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Celebrating the popular success of his novelty, de Marigny gave the name Rue de Craps to a street in his new subdivision in New Orlean", "attachments":[]}
